The response delay has a negative impact on the accuracy of spectrum sensing, which is the cornerstone of cognitive radio. In this paper, single-user prediction of channel state is proposed to minimize the negative impact of response delays caused by hardware platforms. Specifically, a modified hidden Markov model (HMM) based single-secondary-user (single-SU) prediction is proposed and examined. In order to have convincing performance evaluation results, real-world Wi-Fi signals are employed to test the proposed approach, where the Wi-Fi signals are recorded at four different locations simultaneously. Experimental results show that the proposed single-SU prediction outperforms the 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) prediction which uses a detected current state as an estimate of future states.

As a part of the effort toward building a cognitive radio network testbed, we have demonstrated real-time spectrum sensing. However, current hardware platforms for cognitive radio introduce time delays that actually undermine the accuracy of spectrum sensing. The time delay, named response delay, incurred by hardware and software can be measured at the receiving antenna and the transmitting antenna co-located at a secondary user (SU). In this paper, minimum response delays are experimentally quantified and reported based on two hardware platforms, the universal software radio peripheral 2 (USRP2) and the small form factor software defined radio development platform (SFF SDR DP). In a subsequent paper, an approach for single-user prediction is proposed to combat with the response delays. This work is a part of the effort toward building a cognitive radio network testbed.},

  Abstract                 = {Cognitive radio networks have been proposed as a solution to both spectrum inefficiency and spectrum scarcity problems. However, they face to a unique challenge based on the fluctuating nature of heterogeneous spectrum bands as well as the diverse service requirements of various applications. In this paper, a spectrum decision framework is proposed to determine a set of spectrum bands by considering the application requirements as well as the dynamic nature of spectrum bands. To this end, first, each spectrum is characterized by jointly considering primary user activity and spectrum sensing operations. Based on this, a minimum variance-based spectrum decision is proposed for real-time applications, which minimizes the capacity variance of the decided spectrum bands subject to the capacity constraints. For best-effort applications, a maximum capacity-based spectrum decision is proposed where spectrum bands are decided to maximize the total network capacity. Moreover, a dynamic resource management scheme is developed to coordinate the spectrum decision adaptively dependent on the time-varying cognitive radio network capacity. Simulation results show that the proposed methods provide efficient bandwidth utilization while satisfying service requirements.},

  Abstract                 = {Spectrum decision is the ability of a cognitive radio (CR) to select the best available spectrum band to satisfy secondary users' (SUs') quality of service (QoS) requirements, without causing harmful interference to licensed or primary users (PUs). Each CR performs spectrum sensing to identify the available spectrum bands and the spectrum decision process selects from these available bands for opportunistic use. Spectrum decision constitutes an important topic which has not been adequately explored in CR research. Spectrum decision involves spectrum characterization, spectrum selection and CR reconfiguration functions. After the available spectrum has been identified, the first step is to characterize it based not only on the current radio environment conditions, but also on the PU activities. The second step involves spectrum selection, whereby the most appropriate spectrum band is selected to satisfy SUs' QoS requirements. Finally, the CR should be able to reconfigure its transmission parameters to allow communication on the selected band. Key to spectrum characterization is PU activity modelling, which is commonly based on historical data to provide the means for predicting future traffic patterns in a given spectrum band. This paper provides an up-to-date survey of spectrum decision in CR networks (CRNs) and addresses issues of spectrum characterization (including PU activity modelling), spectrum selection and CR reconfiguration. For each of these issues, we highlight key open research challenges. We also review practical implementations of spectrum decision in several CR platforms.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of channel quality prediction in cognitive radio networks is investigated in this paper. First, the spectrum sensing process is modeled as a Non-Stationary Hidden Markov Model (NSHMM), which captures the fact that the channel state transition probability is a function of the time interval the primary user has stayed in the current state. Then the model parameters, which carry the information about the expected duration of the channel states and the spectrum sensing accuracy (detection accuracy and false alarm probability) of the SU, are estimated via Bayesian inference with Gibbs sampling. Finally, the estimated NSHMM parameters are employed to design a channel quality metric according to the predicted channel idle duration and spectrum sensing accuracy. Extensive simulation study has been performed to investigate the effectiveness of our design. The results indicate that channel ranking based on the proposed channel quality prediction mechanism captures the idle state duration of the channel and the spectrum sensing accuracy of the SUs, and provides more high quality transmission opportunities and higher successful transmission rates at shorter spectrum waiting times for dynamic spectrum access.},

  Abstract                 = {Cognitive Radio (CR) is a next-generation wireless communication system that enables unlicensed users to exploit underutilized licensed spectrum to optimize the utilization of the overall radio spectrum. A Distributed Cognitive Radio Network (DCRN) is a distributed wireless network established by a number of unlicensed users in the absence of fixed network infrastructure such as a base station. Context awareness and intelligence are the capabilities that enable each unlicensed user to observe and carry out its own action as part of the joint action on its operating environment for network-wide performance enhancement. These capabilities can be applied in various application schemes in CR networks such as Dynamic Channel Selection (DCS), congestion control, and scheduling. In this paper, we apply Reinforcement Learning (RL), including single-agent and multi-agent approaches, to achieve context awareness and intelligence. Firstly, we show that the RL approach achieves a joint action that provides better network-wide performance in respect to DCS in DCRNs. The multi-agent approach is shown to provide higher levels of stability compared to the single-agent approach. Secondly, we show that RL achieves high level of fairness. Thirdly, we show the effects of network density and various essential parameters in RL on the network-wide performance.},

An improved genetic spectrum assignment model is proposed, the population of genetic algorithm is composed of sets of feasible assignment and infeasible assignment. The penalty function is added to the fitness function, and the fitness of chromosomes that dissatisfied with the constraints are reduced, thus the feasible assignment is achieved with the objective of maximizing the system utility. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher system utility with relatively more cognitive users under the condition of same population size and other related parameter.},

In this letter, spectrum allocation model is presented firstly, and then spectrum allocation methods based on genetic algorithm (GA), quantum genetic algorithm (QGA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO), are proposed. To decrease the search space we propose a mapping process between the channel assignment matrix and the chromosome of GA, QGA, and the position of the particle of PSO, respectively, based on the characteristics of the channel availability matrix and the interference constraints. Results show that our proposed methods greatly outperform the commonly used color sensitive graph coloring algorithm.},
